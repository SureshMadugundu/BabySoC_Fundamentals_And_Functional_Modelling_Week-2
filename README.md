# BabySoC Fundamentals & Functional Modelling â€“ Week 2  

Welcome to my Week 2 work on **VSDBabySoC**, where I explore the fundamentals of **System-on-Chip (SoC)** design and perform **functional modelling** of the **BabySoC** using simulation tools. This repository documents both my **conceptual understanding** and **hands-on experiments** with simulation waveforms.

## ðŸ“š About This Repository  
This repository is intended for students and beginners who want to learn about:  

- Basics of **SoC architecture** (CPU, memory, peripherals, interconnect)  
- Why **BabySoC** is used as a simplified model for learning SoC concepts  
- Importance of **functional modelling** before RTL and physical design  
- Hands-on simulation of BabySoC using **Icarus Verilog** and **GTKWave**  
- Observing system-level behavior like reset, clocking, and dataflow  

---

## ðŸ›  Tools Used  
- **Icarus Verilog (iverilog):** Compiling and simulating Verilog RTL  
- **GTKWave:** Visualizing simulation waveforms  
- **Git:** Version control for project files and documentation
